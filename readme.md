## Using machine learning with stereo cameras as a low-cost substitute for LiDAR and RADAR sensors used in vehicle autonomy

This project explores the feasibility of using stereo cameras as a replacement for LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and RADAR (radio detection and ranging) sensors in the context of vehicle autonomy.

Written in Python and utilises a custom trained YOLOv5 algorithm for object detection.

The accompanying paper goes into detail on the research and implementation:
